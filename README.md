# LEAP - LawConnect

Hi Sebastian / team @ Leap! This is my submission for the coding assessment. It is deployed for viewing on netlify [here](https://law-connect.netlify.app/). Overall, I recreated the website as close to the wireframe as possible, in all possible viewports - mobile first, then tablet, then desktop. One detail I paid particular attention to was the navbar and the hamburger menu in mobile view. The navbar and hamburger menu both have a glass effect, and the hamburger menu has an animated toggle button for opening and closing the menu. Other than that, I simply stuck true to the design. Thank you for putting in the time to assess my work!
